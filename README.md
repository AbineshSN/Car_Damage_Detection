# Car_Damage_Detection

Overview

Car Damage Detection is a machine learning project developed in Jupyter Notebooks to automate the identification and classification of vehicle damage using computer vision techniques. By leveraging deep learning models, the project analyzes images of cars to detect damaged areas and categorize the type (e.g., dents, scratches, cracks) and severity (minor, moderate, severe) of the damage. This tool is designed for applications in automotive insurance, vehicle repair, and inspection industries, offering an efficient and accurate solution for damage assessment. The project is implemented primarily in Python and documented through interactive .ipynb files, making it accessible for experimentation and further development.

Objectives





Develop a robust system to detect and localize damage on vehicle surfaces from images.



Classify detected damage by type and severity to support automated decision-making.



Provide clear, reproducible workflows via Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.



Enable visualization of results, including annotated images and model performance metrics, to enhance interpretability.



Create a scalable framework that can be adapted for custom datasets or integrated into larger systems.

Key Components





Data Preprocessing: Handles image loading, resizing, augmentation, and normalization to prepare datasets for model training. Supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG).



Object Detection: Uses deep learning models to identify and localize damaged areas with bounding boxes.



Damage Classification: Applies classification models to categorize damage types and assess severity levels.



Model Evaluation: Includes metrics like precision, recall, and mAP for detection, and accuracy for classification, visualized through plots and tables.



Result Visualization: Generates annotated images with damage locations and confidence scores, alongside performance charts for model analysis.



Jupyter Notebooks: Organizes the workflow into modular .ipynb files for data exploration, model training, inference, and result visualization.

Technologies Used





Programming Language: Python 3.8+



Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn



Computer Vision Tools: OpenCV, Albumentations



Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas



Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn



Deep Learning Models: YOLO (e.g., YOLOv8), Faster R-CNN for detection; ResNet, EfficientNet for classification



Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Conda or Pip for dependency management



Version Control: Git

Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of labeled vehicle images, typically including thousands of photos with annotations for damage locations, types, and severity. Annotations are in formats like COCO or Pascal VOC, with bounding boxes for detection and labels for classification. Due to licensing, the dataset is not included in the repository. Users can use their own datasets or publicly available ones, such as those found on platforms like Kaggle.
